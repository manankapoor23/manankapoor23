## 🧠 AI Systems & LLM Internals (Current Focus)

I’m exploring **how modern AI systems actually run under the hood** — not just how to call APIs.

My current focus is on **LLM inference, memory management, and production-scale design**, bridging **deep learning + systems engineering**.

### 🔍 What I’m Studying
- Autoregressive decoding in transformer models  
- **Key–Value (KV) cache mechanics**  
- Inference-time memory behavior  
- Latency vs throughput tradeoffs  
- Why naïve inference implementations break at scale  

I strongly believe **understanding inference is as important as training models**.

---

### 🔬 Recent Deep Dive: KV Cache (Hands-on)

I implemented and experimented with a **naive KV-cache** using open-source transformer models to understand real inference behavior.

**Key insights:**
- KV cache correctly avoids recomputing attention for past tokens  
- Naive KV cache **grows unbounded** in multi-turn conversations  
- In production:
  - Prompt & response lengths are unknown
  - Contiguous allocation becomes fragile
  - Memory fragmentation and waste increase over time
  - Decoder-side memory pressure continuously grows
- Framework-level KV caches abstract memory layout, limiting control  

 **Conclusion:** Naive KV caching is *correct*, but **not scalable**.

---

###  What I’m Exploring Next: Paged KV Cache

I’m now working on a **paged KV-cache design**, inspired by production inference engines, to understand:

- How fixed-size KV pages prevent fragmentation  
- Decoupling logical token order from physical memory  
- Prefix reuse: *compute once, reuse many times*  
- Reference counting & copy-on-write for safe sharing  
- How OS concepts (paging, virtual memory) apply directly to LLM inference  

> **KV cache enables reuse over time.  
> Paging enables reuse over space.**

### 🛠 Tech Stack (Systems + AI)
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- Apple Silicon (CPU / MPS)  
- Inference debugging, profiling & benchmarking  
- API usage: **OpenAI SDK, Google APIs**, and modern ML tooling  

I prefer **correctness, clarity, and understanding** over chasing benchmarks.

---

###  What I Care About
- AI **systems**, not just AI models  
- How things **scale**, not just how they work once  
- Building mental models, not copying code  
- Treating CS fundamentals as **skills**, not subjects
